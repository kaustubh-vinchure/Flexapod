# Flexapod
Senior Design Project for USC BS Astronautical Engineering

## Description
In a team of 4, we built a model of a 6-DOF Platform similar to a Stewart-Gough table. My contribution to the project was to write the software to control and test the platform. The report in Data covers key goals and challenges. This project used OpenCV's Python library to accurately track a laser pointer to control a 6 degree of freedom platform.
